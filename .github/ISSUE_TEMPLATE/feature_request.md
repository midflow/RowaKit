## Problem statement

What problem are you trying to solve? Why doesn’t the current API work?

## Proposed solution

Describe the API/UX you want.

## Scope check

RowaKit is server-side-first and intentionally not a generic data grid.
Please confirm:

- [ ] This request does not require virtualization / infinite scroll
- [ ] This request does not require grouping/pivot/query-builder/spreadsheet editing
- [ ] This aligns with “core small + escape hatch” (e.g., `col.custom()` where appropriate)

## Alternatives considered

What have you tried already?

## Additional context

Links, screenshots, examples.

## Stability note (v1.x)

New APIs added in v1.x should be additive and backward compatible.
Breaking changes are reserved for a future major release (v2.0.0+). See `docs/API_STABILITY.md`.
