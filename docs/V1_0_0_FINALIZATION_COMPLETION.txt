## Verification Results

### ✅ Clarity Test

Future maintainer scenario: *"Is RowaKit ready for v1.0.0?"*

**Can be answered in 5 minutes?** ✅ YES
- Read: `docs/V1_0_0_RELEASE_DECISION.md` → Opens with "**RowaKit v1.0.0 release is APPROVED**"
- See timeline: NO-GO (Jan 10) → Fixes → GO (Jan 12)
- See evidence: B (production-like harness) + C (consumer compat) both PASS
- See authority: Reference to `FINAL_GO_NO_GO_REPORT` for details

---

### ✅ Auditability Test

Future maintainer scenario: *"Why was this initially NO-GO?"*

**Can be explained from current documents?** ✅ YES
- Read: `docs/V1_0_0_RELEASE_READINESS_REPORT.md` (superseded report)
- See notice: "Initially concluded NO-GO on January 10, 2026"
- See reasons: Missing type exports, no production validation
- See resolution: "Missing type exports have been fixed", "Validation policy adopted"
- See evidence: Links to `FINAL_GO_NO_GO_REPORT` and `RELEASE_DECISION`

---

### ✅ Non-Contradiction Test

**Search all docs:** Any active decision document claims NO-GO?

```
V1_0_0_FINAL_GO_NO_GO_REPORT.md       → 🟢 GO ✅
V1_0_0_RELEASE_DECISION.md            → 🟢 GO ✅
V1_0_0_FINALIZATION_RECORD.md         → 🟢 GO ✅
V1_0_0_RELEASE_READINESS_REPORT.md    → 🔴 NO-GO (MARKED AS SUPERSEDED) ✅
V1_0_0_PRE_CHECK_REPORT.md            → Historical (earlier pre-check) ✅
```

**Result:** ✅ No active decision claims NO-GO. All point to same canonical authority.
