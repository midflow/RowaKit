# RowaKit Positioning

## Target Users
- Developers building admin panels, dashboards, and data-heavy business apps
- Teams who want server-side pagination, sorting, filtering, and export
- Those who value predictable, opinionated APIs over grid bloat

## Non-goals
- Not a spreadsheet replacement
- Not for client-only data or in-memory analytics
- Not a generic data grid

## Why Server-Side-First?
- Real-world data lives on the backend
- Enables scalable pagination, filtering, and security
- Keeps frontend thin, fast, and easy to reason about
- Avoids the complexity and bloat of all-in-one grids
