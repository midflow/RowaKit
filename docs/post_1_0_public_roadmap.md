# Public Roadmap — After v1.0.0

> **Project:** RowaKit  
> **Audience:** Users, adopters, sponsors

---

## 🎯 Roadmap Philosophy

RowaKit evolves based on **real demand**, not feature checklists.

After v1.0.0:
- Stability > novelty
- Fewer features, better guarantees
- No drift into spreadsheet-style data grids

---

## ✅ What v1.0.0 Guarantees

- Stable public API
- Predictable server-side-first behavior
- Long-term support mindset

---

## 🟢 Short-Term (v1.1 – v1.2)

**Only if there is real demand:**

- Multi-column sorting (full UX)
- Additional export formats (Excel / PDF)
- Filter presets improvements
- Table state persistence helpers

---

## 🟡 Mid-Term (v1.3 – v1.5)

- Performance tuning (large datasets)
- Accessibility enhancements
- Optional UX polish

---

## 🔵 Commercial / Pro Direction

Commercial extensions will focus on:

- Advanced bulk workflows
- Cross-page selection helpers
- Background export jobs
- Enterprise adapters & support

OSS core remains fully usable.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Not Planned

- Virtual scrolling
- Inline cell editing
- Pivoting / grouping
- Spreadsheet-style features

---

## 🤝 Community Input

- Feature requests via GitHub Issues
- Prioritization driven by real-world usage
- Transparency over hype

---

## 📌 Closing Note

RowaKit’s goal is not to be everything.
It is to be **reliable, predictable, and boring in the best possible way**.
