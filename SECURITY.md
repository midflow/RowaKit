## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Preferred reporting methods (in order):

1. Use GitHub's private Security Advisories / private vulnerability report
	feature for this repository (recommended).
2. If GitHub private reports are not available, email the maintainers at
	**[INSERT YOUR SECURITY EMAIL]** (replace with project security contact).

You should receive an acknowledgement within 48 hours. If you do not, follow
up using the same channel or try the alternate channel above.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, remote code execution)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English. If you must use another
language, include an English summary where possible.

## Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

Once a security issue is reported:

1. We will confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report
2. We will assess the issue and determine its severity
3. We will work on a fix and coordinate a release
4. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is released

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a public bug bounty program. Responsible
disclosure is appreciated and will be acknowledged in release notes when the
fix is published, unless a reporter requests anonymity.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request.
