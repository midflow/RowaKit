## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).

Once a security issue is reported:

1. We will confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report
2. We will assess the issue and determine its severity
3. We will work on a fix and coordinate a release
4. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is released

## Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a bug bounty program. However, we deeply appreciate security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly.
